The target for this project is to create a Credit Risk Solution for a dataset picked up from a Kaggle competition.

The source of the dataset is - 

https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-credit-credit-risk-model-stability

Although this is a delayed submission, if one will, the objective is to create a complete project based modelling process,
which would include every aspect, from data identification, cleaning, engineering to modelling and validation.
